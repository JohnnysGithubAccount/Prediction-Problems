This project is for generalize the idea of how to deal with predicting problems.
house_price_prediction use basic machine learning algorithms for predictiong median house price in a block in California, using the built-in dataset of sklearn, Fetching California Housing. This represent the problems where the data are independence continous variables.
temperature_prediction use LSTM, a form of RNN models to predict the temperature of Hanoi, using a dataset from kaggle, here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities. That represent the problems where the data are dependence continuous varibales.
The neccessary modules are: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow.
